## Key Takeaways for Design

### What the Science Supports

1. **External accountability works for ADHD** - Not because of moral failure, but because ADHD affects working memory and executive function. External systems offload cognitive burden.

2. **Social presence affects performance** - Over a century of social facilitation research shows the mere presence of others changes behavior, though the mechanism is debated.

3. **Implementation intentions are powerful** - "If-then" planning (d = .65 effect size) helps bridge the intention-behavior gap.

4. **AI companions can form therapeutic relationships** - Users rate AI therapeutic alliance comparable to human therapists in some studies.

5. **Dopamine pathways are key** - Social interaction activates dopamine, and ADHD involves dopamine dysregulation affecting motivation.

### What's Uncertain or Missing

1. **Body doubling specifically** - Limited controlled studies; most evidence is anecdotal. Existing RCTs show no significant effect, even when participants perceive benefit.

2. **Mechanism of body doubling** - Multiple competing theories (social facilitation, dopamine, mirror neurons) but no consensus.

3. **AI vs. human presence** - Unknown whether AI can replicate the accountability benefits of actual human presence.

4. **Long-term effects** - Most studies are short-term; unclear if benefits persist.

### Design Implications

Based on this research, the app should:

- **Provide external structure** - Don't rely on user willpower; create external deadlines, check-ins, and accountability
- **Use implementation intentions** - Help users specify when, where, and how they'll work on tasks
- **Build genuine relationship** - Research shows therapeutic alliance matters, even with AI
- **Not lecture or moralize** - ADHD is about brain differences, not character flaws
- **Understand individual variation** - Body doubling doesn't work for everyone; need to adapt to preferences
