# Social Facilitation Theory

## Overview

Social facilitation is the phenomenon where the presence of others affects individual performance. This is one of the oldest research areas in social psychology, with over a century of studies.

## Historical Background

### Triplett (1898)
Norman Triplett from Indiana University made the first formal observation: cyclists performed better when training with peers than alone. This sparked the field of social facilitation research.

### Floyd Allport (1920)
Coined the term "social facilitation" and conducted systematic studies showing improved performance on various tasks when others were present.

## The Critical Finding: Task Complexity Matters

**Simple/Well-Learned Tasks → Performance IMPROVES with others present**
**Complex/Novel Tasks → Performance DECREASES with others present**

This bidirectional effect is crucial for understanding when body doubling might help vs. hurt.

## Key Concepts

### Co-Action Effect
Performing a task in the presence of others doing the same task (even without direct interaction) affects performance.

**Classic examples:**
- Chen (1937): Worker ants dig 3x more sand when other ants are present
- Platt, Yaksh, & Darby (1967): Animals eat more when others are present
- Human studies: Typing speed, exercise performance

### Zajonc's Drive Theory (1965)
Robert Zajonc proposed that the mere presence of others produces physiological arousal, which:
- Increases the probability of the **dominant response**
- For well-practiced tasks: dominant response is correct → performance improves
- For new tasks: dominant response may be wrong → performance worsens

## Meta-Analysis Findings

In the 1980s, researchers analyzed 241 studies with 24,000+ subjects:

**Findings:**
- Presence of others **inhibited** complex performance accuracy
- Presence of others **decreased** speed on complex tasks
- Presence of others **facilitated** simple performance speed
- Less evidence that accuracy improved on simple tasks

## Three Theoretical Approaches

### 1. Activation Theory
The presence of others increases arousal levels. Supported by:
- EEG studies showing increased brain activity
- Salivary cortisol studies showing stress response

### 2. Evaluation Theory
Being assessed or observed by others creates evaluation apprehension. The effect depends on:
- Whether the observer can evaluate performance
- The observer's expertise/status

### 3. Attention Theory
Others in the environment create attentional conflict:
- Attention divided between task and social environment
- This can help (narrowed focus) or hurt (distraction)

## Recent Research: Virtual Presence

**Key question for our project:** Can computer-generated agents produce social facilitation?

Research findings are **mixed:**
- Several experiments confirm social facilitation with virtual agents
- Several others find no effect
- Factors that matter: realism of agents, sense of co-presence

**Frontiers in Psychology study:** Tested moderators of social facilitation in VR, finding that co-presence and realism of virtual agents affected whether the effect occurred.

## Implications for Body Doubling

Social facilitation theory suggests body doubling should:
- **Help** with routine, well-practiced tasks (cleaning, email, familiar work)
- **Potentially hurt** with complex, novel tasks requiring deep thought
- **Depend on** whether the person feels evaluated vs. simply accompanied

## Design Implications

For an AI body doubling companion:

1. **Reduce evaluation anxiety** - Don't make users feel judged
2. **Consider task type** - May need different approaches for simple vs. complex work
3. **Presence without pressure** - The "mere presence" effect doesn't require interaction
4. **Uncertainty about virtual agents** - May not replicate human presence effects
